## Course information

This course is the second half of a year-long sequence on quantum information and computation given at the Institute for Fundamental Study (IF), Naresuan University, academic year 2024. 

The course consists of 30 lectures, 1.5 hours each. The plan is to cover the following topics:

- *Quantum algorithms*: quantum algorithms based on Fourier transform: Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Simon’s algorithm, quantum phase estimation (QPE), hidden subgroup problem (HSP), RSA cryptosystem, Shor's algorithm for factoring and discrete logarithms; Grover’s search algorithm
- *Computability and complexity*: Turing machines; undecidability; the classes P and NP; reduction and NP-completeness; classical circuit model and reversible computation; probabilistic computation
- *Quantum error correction*: classical linear codes; repetition codes and the Shor code; general properties of quantum error-correcting codes; stabilizer formalism; Gottesman-Knill theorem; basics of fault tolerance
- *Advanced topics in quantum computation*: measurement-based quantum computation; topological quantum memory and fault-tolerant computation 

## Resources

There is no single textbook that covers all the topics in my preferred way. 

For quantum algorithms, we will follow Cris Moore and Stephan Mertens
