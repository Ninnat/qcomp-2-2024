## Course information

This course is the second half of a year-long sequence on quantum information and computation given at the Institute for Fundamental Study (IF), Naresuan University, academic year 2024. 

The course consists of 30 lectures, 1.5 hours each. The plan is to cover the following topics:

- *Classical computation and complexity classes*: Turing machines; undecidability; the classes P and NP; reduction and NP-completeness; classical circuit model and reversible computation; probabilistic computation
- *Quantum algorithms*: hidden subgroup problems (Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Simon’s algorithm, factorization); quantum phase estimation (QPE) and quantum Fourier transform (QFT); quantum algorithms for factoring and discrete logarithm problems; Grover’s search algorithm; amplitude amplification (AA)
- *Quantum error correction*: classical linear codes; quantum error models; repetition codes and the Shor code; general properties of quantum error-correcting codes; stabilizer formalism; Gottesman-Knill theorem; basics of fault tolerance
- *Advanced quantum computation*: measurement-based quantum computation; topological quantum memory and fault-tolerant computation
